Hello, resistance, my old friend.  
I see you’ve come to visit once again.

Come in.  
Stay a while.  
Spend the night—hell, spend a few days if you like.

But you know you can’t stay,  
and we can’t be friends.

We’re different, you and I.

You want things to remain the same,  
to be static.

And that goes against nature,  
against the universe.

I want to flow with time.  
I want to embrace change,  
to embrace movement.

And so—yes, you may come in.  
Yes, I may have a chat or two with you.  
I may even break bread with you,  
see how your idea of the static and non-creation  
could seem comforting for a bit.

But we’re not meant to be.

In the end, you must go your way,  
and I must continue mine.

I don’t hate you.  
I accept your existence.

But I know—one of us is condemned  
to never be satisfied,  
as the world will never stop moving.

But hey, old friend,  
come in.

I know you’re restless.
