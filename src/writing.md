I write mostly to understand what’s going on inside my head. Occasionally it works. Often it just leads to more things to write about.

Other times I write to try and make sense of what’s going on in the world. That part fails every time.

- Read my essays → **[Essays]({{ '/essays/' | url }})**
- Read my poems → **[Poetry]({{ '/poetry/' | url }})**
- Read my book notes → **[Book Notes]({{ '/book-notes/' | url }})**

I also send a [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}) you can subscribe to for free if you like my writing.
