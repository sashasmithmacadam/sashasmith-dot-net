Send me an email → sasha@sashasmith.net

Please do reach out — I always reply and genuinely love meeting new people.

*(I will now proceed to geek out in a most proper old brit gent manner — which is the main reason I wanted to create a contact page instead of just having a mailto link.)*

🧐 Why, my most distinguished Sir or Lady, might you wish to contact me?

Well, perhaps to:

- Drop me a line simply to say hello
- Share your admiration for [insert favourite topic]
- Inquire about booking me to perform or speak at your event
- Air your grievances about [insert not-so-favourite topic] (I shall listen politely, of course)
- Propose a daring adventure (treasure map 🗺 → bonus points)
- Purchase one of my paintings for your exquisite private collection
- Regale me with tales of [insert fascinating thing] you've done
- Or simply to say hello again, for good measure!

I look forward to your correspondence — let's have a proper chat!

*(Geek-athon concluded.)*

Seriously, email me and let's chat → sasha@sashasmith.net
