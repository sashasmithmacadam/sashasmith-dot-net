lyrics: |
    Tired eyes
    Like coffee stains
    In old Penguin books
    My mother read
    My mind gets overwhelmed
    When I think
    Of all the people
    I’ve met

    The last few times
    I could feel the pain
    Just by the way they looked
    Never mind what they said
    These days life seems full of dread
    Like if you blink
    You might miss it all
    And you’ll be dead

    Take me back to childhood naps
    When everything was new
    Running off to school and back
    Back to childhood naps

    Fistfights
    Covered in film grain
    Becoming firewood
    For a burning bayonet
    That cuts you a new breath
    So you won’t sink
    All the way down the waterfall
    To start again

    Take me back to childhood naps
    When everything was new
    Running off to school and back
    Back to childhood naps
    Back to childhood naps
    Back to childhood

    Tired eyes
    Like coffee stains
    In old Penguin books
