lyrics: |
    Oh, she can be what you want her to be
    Some say it’s wicked
    The way she takes her victims

    But all she can be is what you’ll tell her to be
    She’s trapped inside your wrath
    La ra ra ra ra

    She won’t tell
    She won’t
    Only when she’s on her own
    Longing to be back home

    Breathing in a fable
    Living for the faithful

    But all she can be is what you’ll tell her to be
    La ra ra ra ra

    She won’t tell
    She won’t
    Only when she’s on her own
    Longing to be back home

    Everything she is
    And what she’s not
    She learnt from you
    Now every move she makes
    Is on you

    She won’t tell
    She won’t
    Only when she’s on her own
    Longing to be back home
