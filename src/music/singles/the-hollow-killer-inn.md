lyrics: |
  I’ve been there
  I’ve been there
  I’ve been there and back
  Walking in your shoes
  Is nothing new

  Voices in my head
  They’re you, I know

  And on my deathbed I will call you
  And we’ll go over everything
  You’ll read me all my sins
  Kristen I will call you
  You’ll be me and I’ll be you
  At The Hollow Killer Inn
  When the evening falls

  I’ve been there
  Adulation in my veins
  I’ve been there and back
  When all of a sudden life is crude
  And you’re the fool

  Sometimes playing dead
  Is a noose, that’s too slow

  And on my deathbed I will call you
  And we’ll go over everything
  You’ll read me all my sins
  Kristen I will call you
  You’ll be me

  And I’ll be you
  I’ll be you
  I’ll be you
  I’ll be you
  I’ll be you
  I’ll be you
  I’ll be you

  Till they call for me
  At The Hollow Killer Inn
  And they’ll call for me
  When the evening falls
  When the evening falls
