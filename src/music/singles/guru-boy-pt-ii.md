lyrics: |
    Guru boy man you got me going hard
    Now I'm thirsty for their blood
    Thinking maybe I'm the judge
    Maybe I'm the one who's coming
    The one who'll show them
    In this war there's a hero and a whore

    Maybe I'm the son you desired
    When you moved on

    Now it's me and your soul
    Me and your soul
    It's me and your soul
    Me and your soul

    Yellow boy walking down the boulevard
    Stacking bodies in the mud
    Turning killers into dust
    I told you I was done pretending
    Don't you worry
    I've got em all queuing up at death's door

    You will rise from their ashes
    A phoenix at dawn

    Now it's me and your soul
    Me and your soul
    It's me and your soul
    Me and your soul

    I like it
    I'm not gonna fail
    I'm the sidekick
    Going off the rails
    Do you like me?
    Do you think I'll fail?
    Am I crazy?
    Going off the rails

    I got it
    You want it
    My blueprint
    My fable
    Those roses
    You're hiding
    They're falling
    Boy you got it 'cause it's in my head
    Faded into the blue

    Now it's me and your soul (me and your soul)
    Me and your soul (falling in love)
    It's me and your soul (me and your soul)
    Me and your soul

    I like it
    I'm not gonna fail
    I'm the sidekick
    Going off the rails
    Do you like me?
    Do you think I'll fail?
    Am I crazy?
    Going off the rails (now it's me and your soul)
    I like it
    I'm not gonna fail (me and your soul)
    I'm the sidekick
    Going off the rails (it's me and your soul)
    Do you like me?
    Do you think I'll fail? (me and your soul)
    Am I crazy?
    Going off the rails (it's me and you)
