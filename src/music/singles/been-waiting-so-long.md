lyrics: |
  I've been waiting so long
  I'm starting to forget what I want
  I've been waiting so long
  Most days the spark is gone

  I’ve been waiting so long
  I’ve been waiting

  Lost in this battle
  Lost in the rain
  Lost in this battle
  Where my hope, it comes and it goes
  Yes my hope, it blankets my pain

  I’ve been waiting so long
  Like a dusty paper doll in the attic of my soul
  I’ve been waiting so long
  Sand dunes and I’m falling handcuffed to a watch

  I’ve been waiting so long
  I’ve been waiting

  Lost in this battle
  Lost in the rain
  Lost in this battle
  Where my hope, it comes and it goes
  My hope, it blankets my rage

  Time slips away
  And only my memory fades
  Salvation come (will my time come?)
  Salvation come (come)
  Come

  Lost in this battle
  Lost in the rain
  Lost in this battle
  Where my hope, it comes and it goes
  And my hope, it blankets my pain
