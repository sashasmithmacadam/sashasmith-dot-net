lyrics: |
    Lately I’ve been living in the place
    Where dreams go to die
    Knowing that I’ll end up in a grave
    Why even try?
    They told me there’ll be moments in my life
    When everything’s

    Fucking perfect
    Fucking perfect

    Waking up to the morning sun
    Drops of rain on the window panes
    Outside cats at play
    That could be one

    The one you love holding your son
    Half a smile from your other child
    At night you’re alone for a while

    It's fucking perfect
    Fucking perfect

    One last chance when you thought you were beat
    You come out swinging, you’re grinning
    Oh Christ, now you’re living

    It’s fucking perfect
    Fucking perfect

    It won’t last long
    You’ll think you’ve lost it all
    And just like that
    It’ll come back

    Fucking perfect
    Fucking perfect

    I live for the moments in my life
    When everything’s fucking perfect
