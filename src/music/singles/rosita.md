lyrics: |
  Rosita, send me to hell
  Won’t you?
  This fever’ll put me to death
  Yeah
  ‘Cos I’ve been insane
  Standing in your way

  You confused me when you said
  “I can’t believe your River’s dead”
  Seven days
  I know

  Rosita, quit with the threats
  Won’t you?
  Release her and take me instead
  Yeah
  Down on my knees
  Set her free

  You confused me when you said
  “I can’t believe your River’s dead”
  Seven days
  I know

  Every truth I left unsaid
  Coming back to make me beg
  Now Rosita’s in my head
  In my head
  In my head

  You confused me when you said
  “I can’t believe your River’s dead”
  Seven days
  I know
