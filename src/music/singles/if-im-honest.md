lyrics: |
  If I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why
  If I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why

  I think it's easier to know
  Something ain't gonna work out
  It's easier than looking inside of me
  To see what's wrong
  I know it's much easier to blame
  This fucked up world
  And you, every single fucking one of you
  For having me misunderstood

  If I hate you
  Will you love me?
  If I hate you
  Will you?

  'cause if I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why
  If I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why

  Self sabotage, sweeter than any other drug
  Of course I wouldn't know
  But I'm pretty sure I'm right
  It's much easier to stay put
  Than to even fake a move
  Much nicer to remain
  Than to leave everything behind

  If I hate you
  Will you love me?
  If I hate you
  Will you?

  'cause if I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why
  If I’m honest I’m addicted to losing
  Real honest, I’m a sucker for the losing side
  I don’t even wanna know why
  No, I don’t even wanna know why

  If I'm honest
  Will you love me?
  If I'm honest
  Really honest
  Will you love me?
  If I'm honest
  If I'm honest
  If I'm honest
