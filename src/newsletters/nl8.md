Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

**Resistance (capital R) is an old friend.** A familiar shadow that arrives when something important is on the verge of being finished.

I’ve felt it this past week. It crept in as I worked on my next song, *Childhood Naps*.

It came from the inside—the reluctance to let go of something that, once released, is no longer truly mine.

And it came from the outside—construction noise, broken gates, even a nasty hit to the head that left me dizzy for a day.

The form changes, but the function remains: **Resistance exists to stop us from doing the work.**

But here’s the thing: **we can overcome Resistance.**

We can stare it down, sit with it, even break bread with it—**but we do not let it stay.**

Here’s how my own wrestling match with Resistance went this week.

**→ What I’m Creating — Ode to Resistance**

At a breaking point, I stopped fighting and instead wrote directly *to* Resistance. The result was a kind of **poem-essay**, something I didn’t plan, but that feels like it will stay with me for a long time.

And if you’d rather listen, I filmed a video where I talk about how Resistance has been showing up for me, read the piece aloud, and reflect on what I learned from the process.

**→ What I’m Learning — The Value of Surrender**

We often think we need to **push through** Resistance. To grit our teeth, to force our way forward. Sometimes, that works.

But sometimes, what we need is **to surrender to the moment.**

Not in defeat, but in **curiosity**.

In my case, instead of forcing my way through the work, I sat down and wrote *to* Resistance. And in doing so, I found my way forward.

Resistance will always return, but I’ll always have this piece of writing now. And I like that.

Maybe next time you feel stuck, instead of pushing harder, **pause. Listen. Write. See what emerges.**

**→ What I’m Loving**

**⨀ Seeing My Cats Explore the Garden**

We took [Snowy]({{ '/about/#personal' | url }}) out this morning, and she was loving all the new smells. She roamed, sniffed, took it all in. And in the end, she just laid out in the sun, happy. Cats *get* life on a different level—they just *know* what’s up.

**⨀ Dexter**

We finished it.

As a creator, I always think about how hard it must be to **write an ending for something that’s been loved for so long.** I think they did a good job. I won’t spoil it for you.

Next up: **Dexter: New Blood** and **Dexter: Original Sin**. I’ll keep you posted.

Resistance isn’t the enemy. It’s just a **test**. A force that asks: **Do you really want this? Will you show up anyway?**

I hope this week, in whatever way it applies to you, **you show up.**

**Sash**

P.S. I’d love to know—do you like [this type of video](https://youtu.be/xC9-3ZE47UA)? The unscripted, in-the-moment wrestling with an idea on camera rather than a polished essay? Hit reply and let me know. I certainly had fun making it.
