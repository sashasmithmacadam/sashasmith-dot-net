Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

I hope you had a good holiday break.

If you’re like me, getting back to routine can feel comforting after the more “chaotic” holidays.

The last couple of years I’ve learned to lean into these off-balance moments instead of fighting them — being present with family and friends, letting the work rest for a bit.

But now, time to slip back into our rhythm! Here’s what’s been [happening on my end]({{ '/2025-01-07/' | url }})…

**⨀ What I’m** [**Creating**]({{ '/projects/' | url }})

→ [*Fucking Perfect* — Official Video](https://youtu.be/ZxAR0LdQ8OM)

I just shot an [official video](https://youtu.be/ZxAR0LdQ8OM) at sunset, right outside my studio. It’s the same view I’m lucky to see every day while I work — today, a mysterious haze; on filming day, a symphony of orange and pink.

Watch it here: [sashasmith.net/fp]({{ '/fp/' | url }})

→ Next Track — *She Can Be*

[Currently]({{ '/2025-01-07/' | url }}) in the works.

Recording acoustic guitars today. I think I’ll record two takes and pan them completely right and left. It’s fingerpicked, so the subtle differences between performances will make for a nice stereo effect.

→ [Video Adaptation](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo) of [*Redefining Success in Art*]({{ '/success/' | url }})

I’ve had very encouraging feedback on this [essay]({{ '/success/' | url }}), so I’m stepping outside my comfort zone and turning it into a [video essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo). A fun little project!

It’ll be out in a few days — I’ll share the link in the next newsletter.

Meanwhile, you should [subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhoFM7as8mX-QAN27657kw), so you never miss new music, video essays, and behind the scenes process videos.

**⨀ What I’m Learning — Sticking With It Beyond Inspiration**

I’m an idea person, constantly juggling [new plans]({{ '/about/#new-era' | url }}) and experiments.

Maybe you’re the same.

One challenge for us can be riding the wave after the initial burst of inspiration — sticking with the work once it’s rolling, and resisting shiny object syndrome.

But now that I’m on the path I want to be on (my “[new era]({{ '/about/#new-era' | url }})”), I’m realizing the importance of consistency. I’ve set up systems ([website]({{ '/' | url }}), [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}), etc.) that free me to focus on what matters: creating art and connecting with you.

It’s a reminder that we don’t always need to reinvent ourselves — especially not just because it’s a new year and everyone else is doing it.

Sometimes it’s enough to know who we are and do the day-to-day work.

Think of someone like [Akira Nakai](https://youtu.be/qm95f86a4Hw?si=U5VdEmYzjqNGkvD_), who’s been modifying the same Porsches for two decades — consistent, repeated craftmanship.

**⨀ What I’m Loving**

My sister gave me Rick Rubin’s [*The Creative Act*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act) for Christmas, and now feels like the perfect time to really savour our holiday gifts — to appreciate why our loved ones chose them and see how they fit into our lives.

The book’s fantastic. It beautifully captures many of the ways I feel about making music and art.

If you’re in a creative field, check it out — the hardcover is gorgeous!

A neat [synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity): he uses the symbol ⨀ in his book, the same one I often use. Something there… like minds gravitate to similar aesthetics?

Thanks for pausing with me this Wednesday (Don’t you just love that midweek feeling? No? Just me?).

Remember, we don’t always need a grand reinvention — sometimes it’s enough to keep building on what’s already working. I need that reminder, too!

Wishing you a consistent rest of the week 😉

**Sash**

P.S. If you enjoyed this issue, I’d love for you to forward it to a friend who might love it, too. Human connection beats algorithms every time — thank you for being part of mine.

Also, how did [*Fucking Perfect*]({{ '/fp/' | url }}) sound to you? I’ve been getting great feedback on it, which is huge for me since I took a leap of faith mixing and mastering it myself. I’m convinced this natural, raw production style is the way forward — more human, more real.
