Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

Hope your life’s been moving along nicely this week. As Robert Frost said:

“In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: it goes on.”

And speaking of things going on… my website’s been acting up today, so if any of the links don’t work, they should be fine by tomorrow. The video essay is on YouTube, so you can still [watch it there](https://youtu.be/pDtcGrB8LeE) without any issues.

Onward.

**→ What I’m Creating**

**⨀ New [Essay]({{ '/witness/' | url }}) & [Video Essay](https://youtu.be/pDtcGrB8LeE) — The Artist’s Journey**

Most people see—but few truly witness.

In my latest [essay]({{ '/witness/' | url }}) and [video essay](https://youtu.be/pDtcGrB8LeE), I explore the artist’s journey—the transformation from passive seer to active witness. It’s not about talent or skill, but about how you perceive the world around you.

Are you just seeing? Or are you witnessing life like an artist?

Read (or watch!) and let me know which stage of the artist’s journey you’re in (anyone can be an artist) → [sashasmith.net/witness]({{ '/witness/' | url }}) or [https://youtu.be/pDtcGrB8LeE](https://youtu.be/pDtcGrB8LeE)

**⨀ *She Can Be* – Official Video (Out Friday!)**

We shot a video for [*She Can Be*]({{ '/scb/' | url }}) yesterday on a little dirt road I often walk [near Iribas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aHQ1rjKPK61Zx5Hn6), close to where I live. It’s coming out this Friday.

**→ What I’m Learning**

**⨀ Mandolin**

I got a mandolin for my birthday, and I’m now learning to play it. Fun times—it’s been a while since I’ve learned a new instrument.

It’s got 8 strings (4 pairs of 2), tuned the same way as a violin. I played violin as a kid, but apparently, 0% of that knowledge carried over—because I remember absolutely nothing. The tuning is also flipped compared to a guitar’s first four strings, which is bending my brain a bit.

It’ll be nice to have a new texture to add to my productions.

**→ What I’m Loving**

**⨀ Stretching & Foam Rolling**

I usually exercise at midday and do some stretching before and after, but recently, I’ve been doing longer evening sessions, and I’m loving it.

For the first time, I actually feel good after stretching (also, I’m finally regaining mobility in my left hip, which has hurt for years!). With Marta being a yoga instructor, I’m sure her guidance is making all the difference.

**⨀ Dexter**

We’re on season 8. The last one. The anxiety is real. Love it.

**⨀ [Ocie Elliott](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5jbk18C7YXRcEZxUWPJCyT?si=7fsbHhGHStyEvD4ATXOaVw)**

We’ve loved [Ocie](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5jbk18C7YXRcEZ) for a long time—perfect for the car, cooking, chilling… Do yourself a favour and put them on tonight.

**Sash**

P.S. *She Can Be* official video this Friday. Acoustic with Marta next Friday. New song the week after that. I’ll tell you the title next week 😉
