Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

This is the very first issue of my newsletter, and I couldn’t think of a better time for it to arrive than January 1, 2025.

A new year, [a fresh start]({{ '/about/#new-era' | url }}), and the perfect moment to share what I’ve been creating, thinking, and loving.

**⨀ New Song**

My latest track, [*Fucking Perfect*]({{ '/fp/' | url }}), is out now. It’s raw, honest, and a little messy — just like the name suggests.

Listen here → [sashasmith.net/fp]({{ '/fp/' | url }})

**⨀ Redefining Success in Art**

I wrote an [essay]({{ '/success/' | url }}) exploring what it really means, to me, to “succeed” as an artist.

Spoiler: It’s not about the numbers.

Read it here → [sashasmith.net/success]({{ '/success/' | url }})

**⨀ Book Notes —** **_Zorba the Greek_**

I love [re-reading this]({{ '/zorba/' | url }}) at the start of a new year.

It grounds me in what really matters about life: passion, freedom, and fully embracing the present moment.

**⨀ What I’m Loving**

I’m rewatching _Dexter_, and it’s as twisted and brilliant as I remembered.

If you’re looking for something binge-worthy, this might be it.

**⨀ On Aesthetics and Witnessing Beauty**

Crafting the aesthetic for [my new single]({{ '/fp/' | url }}) and EP artwork has been a joy.

It’s about slowing down, truly [*seeing*]({{ '/ojo/' | url }}) the world (not just _looking_ at it), and capturing its beauty in art.

I’m writing my next essay on this — being an artist isn’t about identity or output, it’s more so a state of being, a way of witnessing life unfold.

Thanks for taking a moment to pause here with me.

Here’s to a year of seeing, creating, and sharing the beauty all around us.

And thank you for being here early in this new chapter — for putting your trust in me and my work.

**Sash**

P.S. This newsletter grows entirely through word of mouth, and in these early days I’m relying on the first people reading it — you.

If you enjoyed this issue, it would mean a lot if you forwarded it to someone you think might enjoy it too. If each person shares it with just one other person, we can rise above the noise of this busy world together.

I’m no longer afraid to [ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMj_P_6H69g) directly — whether it’s sharing my art or this newsletter — because I really do believe in [human connection over algorithms]({{ '/about/#new-era' | url }}).

Thank you for being here. It _truly_ means everything to me.
