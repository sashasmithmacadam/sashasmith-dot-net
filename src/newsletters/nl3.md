Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

[Last week]({{ '/nl2/' | url }}), I mentioned how good it felt to slip back into my routine. Well, this week’s been intense — in the best way. Let’s get into it:

**→ What I’m [Creating]({{ '/projects/' | url }})**

**⨀ Redefining Success in Art — [Video Essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo)**

I just uploaded a [video essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo) based on my [*Redefining Success in Art*]({{ '/success/' | url }}) piece, and it was a fantastic (and slightly nerve-racking) project.

Watch it here → [https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo)

**⨀ [Acoustic Video](https://youtu.be/xf5AH9q50fU) of _Fucking Perfect_**

I teamed up with Marta for a more [stripped-down version](https://youtu.be/xf5AH9q50fU). People seem to love it, and honestly, she has a way of making everything better.

**→ What I’m Learning — The Edge of Comfort**

[I’ve said it before]({{ '/' | url }}): I’m at my best at the intersection between intuition and thinking.

This [video essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo) project hit that sweet spot.

I got to use lots of my technical skills — writing, narration, composing music, filming, and editing — and then trust my intuition to stitch it all together with just the right pacing and aesthetics.

It was both scary and exciting, which usually means something good is happening. Growing pains, maybe? Have you felt that scary/exciting combo lately? If so, [I’d love to hear about it]({{ '/contact/' | url }}).

**→ What I’m Loving — The Addict & The Artist**

I’ve been revisiting [_Turning Pro_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14912777-turning-pro) by Steven Pressfield. If you need a nudge to take your creative pursuits more seriously (and maybe scare yourself a bit), this is it.

One part that really stuck with me is the parallel he draws between addicts and artists — how [self-sabotage](https://youtu.be/UvwDylYNVQ8?feature=shared&t=90) can creep in when we’re on the verge of something meaningful.

It instantly reminded me of my song [*if i’m honest*]({{ '/honest/' | url }}). Looking back, that song feels like it’s in total harmony with what Steven explores in _Turning Pro_.

Thanks for being here, and for letting me share these little steps in my ongoing adventure.

Wishing you a week filled with your own flavour of scary-exciting growth.
