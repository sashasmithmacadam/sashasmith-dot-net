Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

Today is my birthday. I’m 32.

Here’s a list of amazing people who died at 32: Bruce Lee, Alexander the Great, John Bonham, Keith Moon, [Cass Elliott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRe648clNjg), Srinivasa Ramanujan.

Their lives were short but incredibly impactful. It’s inspiring to think of all they accomplished — a reminder to keep going, raise my game, and make it count!

**→ What I’m Creating**

**⨀ New Essay → _“[The Rhythm of Creativity]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }})”_**

This week, I reflected on the contraction (artistic output) and expansion (rest) of an artist’s soul.

With time, I’ve learnt that nonstop contraction leads to burnout. I still slip into old habits, but I’m better at [honouring my own creative rhythm]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }}) now.

**⨀ New Poems**

I uploaded [seven new poems]({{ '/poetry/' | url }}) to my website.

My personal favourite → _“[el sol en la cara]({{ '/sol/' | url }})”_

**⨀ Next Single → _She Can Be_**

My goal is to release this by the end of January (which is coming up fast!).

It’s been a deceptively tricky song to produce and mix — one of those where the challenge sneaks in when you least expect it.

But I’m starting to see the light and feeling confident I’ll pull it off in time.

**→ What I’m Learning**

**⨀ Book Notes — [*Blood, Sweat, and Pixels*]({{ '/pixels/' | url }})**

I just posted [notes]({{ '/pixels/' | url }}) on this fascinating book about the unpredictable art of making video games.

It’s a much more non-linear creative process than music, painting, or writing.

Seeing the contrast between big studio projects (_Uncharted_) and indie solo efforts (_Stardew Valley_) was especially eye-opening.

As a creator, I’m naturally drawn to the indie approach — the scrappy determination and personal vision really resonate with me.

**⨀ Slowing Down**

Funnily enough, slowing down seems to be [the answer to almost everything]({{ '/respiraciones/' | url }}).

I was reminded of this recently in swimming: I couldn’t get my breathing or heart rate to settle, no matter how hard I tried. When I finally slowed down, everything clicked — I’m swimming more lengths now, watch out [Léon Marchand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWVSV4GuQA)!

It’s a great reminder for all areas of life: creative, professional, personal.

When you’re tempted to rush, try slowing down instead.

**→ What I’m Loving**

This week, I’m grateful for my body.

I’ve been exercising a lot, and it’s a blessing to have a healthy body that responds well to training.

Birthdays always remind me of mortality (see: how I opened this email), but they also remind me to appreciate what I have — and there’s still a lot of youth left to enjoy.

Thanks for being here with me. Signing off from Lekunberri now and heading to Donosti to celebrate with friends.

A closing thought:

> “Don’t fear failure. — Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.”  
> ~ Bruce Lee

A fitting reminder as I celebrate another year of life — and another week of creating, learning, and growing.

And happy one-month birthday to this little newsletter — today’s the 4th issue!

**Sash**

P.S. How old are you? And when is _your_ birthday?
