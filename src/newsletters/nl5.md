Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}):

Hola amigos! Keeping it brief(ish) today—I just wrapped up an intense day of work. Let’s get into it:

**→ What I’m Creating**

**⨀ New Song Out This Friday → _She Can Be_**

Last week, I told you this song was proving deceptively tricky to finish, but I was starting to see the light… Well, I made it in time!

I finished mixing last night, and everything’s set for release this Friday. This will be the second single from my upcoming EP _Running Down Dark Alleys Blind_.

I’ll send you a link when it goes live!

**⨀ New [Video Essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgJP_iyQN7Y)**

As soon as I sent _She Can Be_ off to Spotify, I sat down and recorded a [new video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgJP_iyQN7Y).

This one’s different from my last—it’s just me at my desk, reading it out loud. No B-roll, no music, just the words.

Hope you enjoy the simplicity of it → [https://youtu.be/IgJP_iyQN7Y](https://youtu.be/IgJP_iyQN7Y​)

**→ What I’m Learning**

I’m part of a generation that struggles with rest. We either want none of it—always go go go—or we overdo it, sinking into perpetual Netflix and chill mode.

I can feel the contraction from pushing to finish _She Can Be_ in time for its release. Now that it’s done, it’s time to expand again—before diving into the rest of the EP.

Here’s the mantra I kept at the top of my notes while finishing the song:

_“This is now done—I’m releasing it and letting go. Thank you for the joy of creation.”_

The key is recognising when your job is done—and realising it’s not your job to worry about how it’s received.

Your only job is to be thankful for the joy you experienced in making it. That’s what stays with you. The rest is up to chance, not something we need to carry as artists.

If you can truly embrace that, your creative output becomes easier to sustain. Try it. And yes, it takes active effort. If it feels uncomfortable, good—that means you’re growing.

**→ What I’m Loving**

**⨀ _Dexter_, Season 7**

It’s getting intense, but we’re loving it. Marta tenses up during chase scenes, while I happily eat my cereal.

I actually watched almost all of _Dexter_ years ago but never finished it. I have this weird habit of leaving the last few episodes of a series unwatched… But this time, I’ll see it through.

**⨀ Winter**

I was telling Marta yesterday how much more aware I am of the seasons now. It’s like I hadn’t really paid attention before—just let them pass by.

Now I’m fully into winter, embracing it, but also looking forward to spring: biking again, running in less freezing weather.

Thanks for reading. I’ll send another email this week when _She Can Be_ comes out.

It’s been a great one to create—I started writing it 4 or 5 years ago, and now it’s finally coming out. Exciting times!

**Sash**

P.S. Winter appreciation club, anyone? There’s something about training in the cold that feels extra rewarding—like a little Stoic test of discipline. I love running in the rain when everyone else is home. Do you embrace winter or just endure it?
