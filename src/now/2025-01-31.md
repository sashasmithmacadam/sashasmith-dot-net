## Music

_[She Can Be]({{ '/scb/' | url }})_ is out!

## Video Essays

Filmed a [new video essay](https://youtu.be/IgJP_iyQN7Y) for [_[The Rhythm of Creativity]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }})_.

After getting a little burnt out from [the first one](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo) (which took a long time to create), I kept this one simple—just me reading from my desk. No music, no edits.

## Reading & Writing

Finished Turning Pro by Steven Pressfield—loved it.

His writing is always sharp and to the point. Book notes coming soon in my [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}).

## Running & Fitness

Upped my weekly runs from 3 to 5 by adding two easy sessions—really into running at the moment.

5K race next week—fitness isn’t quite where I wanted it to be, but I’ll give it my best!

## Creative Momentum

Now that I’ve released [a second song]({{ '/scb/' | url }}), been sending my [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}) consistently for over a month, and regularly updating [here]({{ '/then/' | url }}), publishing [poems]({{ '/poetry/' | url }}), and sharing my [paintings]({{ '/paintings/' | url }}), I can feel the power of this [new era]({{ '/about/#new-era/' | url }}).

I’m creating more freely, which is making me more efficient at sharing my work. And, most importantly, I feel better about [letting go]({{ '/nl5/' | url }}) of work once it’s done.

No pressure to change my strategy—this time, I know I’m on my true path. And it feels fantastic.
