## New Song

- My single **_[Fucking Perfect]({{ '/fp/' | url }})_** comes out this Friday, Dec 27.
- First time doing my own mixing and mastering — a huge milestone.
- The process was exciting, scary, and tough. Now it's time to **let go** and move on to the next project.

## Deep Work

- Working on the next single, **_[She Can Be]({{ '/scb/' | url }})._** Focused on creating and releasing consistently in this [new era]({{ '/about/#new-era/' | url }}).

## Other Work

- Wrapping up a rewarding sprint on the **new website** project — now shifting to ongoing updates.
- Launching my [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}) and [essays]({{ '/essays/' | url }}).

## Exercise

- **Hard winter training** is in full swing: cold, wind, rain — no missed sessions.
- Swimming's addictive — rapid progress as a beginner!
- [Running]({{ '/about/#runner/' | url }}) a race next week ([San Silvestre Donostiarra](https://sansilvestredonostiarra.com/home-CAS.html)) → Aiming for 4:10--4:15/km pace.

## Consistent Schedule

- Steady **rise/sleep** times.
- **Time-blocking** for deep work: 9:30--12:30 & 15:30--18:30 — **long blocks** are the best.
- Midday is always for exercise.

## Mental Health

- Balancing **holiday social events** with planned [solitude time]({{ '/about/#solitude/' | url }}) to stay grounded.

## Reading

- *[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels]({{ '/pixels/' | url }})* by Jason Schreier — gems for my videogame project.
- [_Slow Productivity_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity) by Cal Newport.

## Watching

- [Dexter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)>) (rewatch) — it's still great.
