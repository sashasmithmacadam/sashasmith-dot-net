### Finishing the EP

I haven’t made progress on the EP since April.

There’s been a lot of [resistance]({{ '/ode-to-resistance/' | url }})—a recurring challenge for me. While I’ve been working on other projects, I know I need to get better at finishing what I start before jumping into new things.

Right now, I’m trying to record _[In the End It Comes]({{ '/iteic/' | url }})_, but I’m struggling to commit. I tend to put too much pressure on a song being in its _final_ form. Maybe what I need to remember is: it’s just the final form _for this project_.

### Busking

I did some busking over the summer, but it’s proven too unreliable. The weather here swings between rain and heatwaves, and it’s hard to count on it. Plus, there are a lot of buskers competing for spots, and I don’t enjoy that energy—I end up retreating to quieter corners, which isn’t great for income.

### Still Writing

That songwriting spree I mentioned last time? It kept going. I’ve written over 20 new songs—in English, and even a couple in Basque (a first for me). I’m happy with how they’re turning out.

## Book

Over the summer, I wrote my first book—a novella, about 30k words.

It’s an idea that had been with me for a while, and it came together beautifully. I’ll share more about it soon as it moves into its next stage. I’m really excited about this one.

## Videogame

We’ve pivoted to a new game idea—simpler, with a tighter scope, so we can move faster and actually ship something (hopefully in 2026).

The new concept centers around shepherding and growing a herd of sheep. It’s more unique, more intuitive, and easier to explain—which should also make it easier to market.

## Life

### Running & Cycling

I’ve been moving a lot—more hours than ever this year—and I feel the benefits in a deeper, more intuitive way.

Exercise isn’t optional for me; it’s a daily requirement. When I skip even a day or two, I notice myself getting more anxious and reactive.

The fresh air and the movement keep me grounded.

### Digital Life

I’m considering getting a dumbphone to use most of the day, and only turning on my smartphone once a day to check messaging and socials (only if needed for content output).

I’m not addicted to my phone, but I’d still prefer a little more distance from it.
