### *[She Can Be]({{ '/scb/' | url }})*

- Progress is slower than I'd like (holidays + other projects), but this week's **daily deep work blocks** are non-negotiable.

### *[Fucking Perfect]({{ '/fp/' | url }})*

- Thrilled with the [official video](https://youtu.be/ZxAR0LdQ8OM) we shot at sunset in the studio. Marta helped film, and I love its simple, **timeless** feel.
- An **acoustic** video with Marta is coming soon.

## Videogame

- Big strides: we now have a full v1 of a **GDD (Game Design Document)** with item/character appendices and a clear direction. It's so exciting!

## Writing

### [Newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }})

- The [first issue]({{ '/nl1/' | url }}) is out and the [second one]({{ '/nl2/' | url }}) goes out tomorrow. I'm loving the new rhythm — it feels like every piece in this new era is coming together beautifully.

### Essay → [Video Essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo)

- Adapting my [Redefining Success in Art]({{ '/success/' | url }}) essay into a **[video essay](https://youtu.be/jhiQZtURAwo)**, inspired by my friend Ian's fantastic feedback. Spent all yesterday filming narration/B-roll. Still editing, but I'm pleased about about how it's shaping up.

## Painting

- Took advantage of an overcast day last week to **photograph all my [paintings]({{ '/paintings/' | url }})**. I'll upload them soon and share in the [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}).

## Routine

- Holidays brought some chaos (and rest), but I'm back in work mode, **grateful** for the people in my life and ready to push forward.

## Exercise

### Swimming

- Planning **three weekly sessions** (endurance, class, technique). Keeping a beginner's mind and enjoying the rapid improvement.

### Running

- All my training this month is for a **5K on Feb 9**, aiming to beat my PB. Feeling motivated. Got a key speed session today 💪

## Watching/Reading

- On to **Dexter** Season 5 (recovering from the Season 4 finale shock).
- Reading about *[Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(video_game))* in *[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels]({{ '/pixels/' | url }})* — this book's a treasure, it's already been hugely helpful for game development.
