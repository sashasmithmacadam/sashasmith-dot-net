## Writing

### [Video Essay]({{ '/success/' | url }}) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhiQZtURAwo)

Published last week, and as often happens on algorithmic platforms, the more work we put into projects, the fewer views they get — it’s got around 60 views, while the [acoustic version](https://youtu.be/xf5AH9q50fU) of _[Fucking Perfect]({{ '/fp/' | url }})_ past 1,000.

A humbling reminder that effort doesn’t always equal reach — and that we don’t need to focus on or care about that as artists!

### New Poems

I published [seven new poems]({{ '/poetry/' | url }}) — my personal favourite is _[el sol en la cara]({{ '/sol/' | url }})_.

### New Essay — _[The Rhythm of Creativity]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }})_

Reflecting on the contraction (output) and expansion (rest) of an artist’s soul. With maturity, I’ve learned that nonstop contraction leads to burnout. I still slip into old habits, but I’m better at honouring [my own creative rhythm]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }}) now.

### Book Notes

Just posted notes on _[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels]({{ '/pixels/' | url }})_. It’s a fascinating look at a new art form for me — one that I’m very excited to keep exploring.

## Music

### _[She Can Be]({{ '/scb/' | url }})_

Still facing some production resistance, but slowly pushing through. Hoping to see the light soon!

### _[Fucking Perfect]({{ '/fp/' | url }})_

Now that I have some perspective and just heard the song for the first time in a few weeks, I can say I’m proud of the way it turned out.

## Swimming & Running

I’m hitting the pool three times a week and running consistently.

Consistency, rest (aka sleep), and nutrition are all connected.

Right now, I’m at six sessions total (three runs + three swims) per week and aiming to add double sessions (like swim+run or swim+bike) to boost volume.

## Finding the Balance of Solitude

I’ve been ignoring my solitude walks and can feel the edginess building up. Prioritizing alone time is essential to staying balanced and sane.
