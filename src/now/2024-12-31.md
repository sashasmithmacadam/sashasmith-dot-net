## Music

- **_[Fucking Perfect]({{ '/fp/' | url }})_** is out! Great feedback — stepping outside my comfort zone and trusting my intuition more than ever. **Official video** comes out Friday. Also shot an acoustic video with Marta, which will come out Jan 8, 2025.
- Deep into *She Can Be* — **daily recording and production.** Riding the energy from *[my first single]({{ '/fp/' | url }})* release. This [new era]({{ '/about/#new-era/' | url }}) makes creative deep work and frequent releases feel *easy* — feeling blessed.
- Exploring **banjos and mandolins** for fresh acoustic textures and adding new percussion to my toolkit — it's time for some [new sounds]({{ '/music/' | url }})!
- Loving the process of crafting the aesthetic for my singles and EP. Think I got the perfect photo for the **EP cover** yesterday — will share soon!

## Creative Work

- Sending the first issue of my **[newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }})** tomorrow → Jan 1, 2025.
- Waiting for an **overcast day** (not hard in Lekunberri!) to photograph the rest of my [paintings]({{ '/paintings/' | url }}) for the website.

## Fitness

- Ran the **[San Silvestre Donostiarra](https://www.strava.com/activities/13233672288)** in 35:02 (4:19/km) today — connect with me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/19410393).
- Planning my **winter training** and race schedule — looking for a couple of 5Ks to improve my PB (20:12).

## Game Development

- Working on story, **game design,** and mechanics ahead of Friday's meeting with Ioseba.

## Social

- Catching up with **Frankie and Adri** after a long time apart.

## Reading

- Still loving *[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels]({{ '/pixels/' | url }})*.
