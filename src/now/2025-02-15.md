### _[She Can Be]({{ '/scb/' | url }})_ – [Official Video](https://youtu.be/HWtAdLEc5zE)

One of my favourite [videos](https://youtu.be/HWtAdLEc5zE) we’ve made so far—getting closer to the aesthetic I envision in my mind.

### _[Childhood Naps]({{ '/naps/' | url }})_

Almost done producing it, but feeling some resistance to finishing.

I’ve been juggling a lot lately, and sitting down to do the work remains the hardest part.

Now that I’m deep into the second half of the EP, I know this phase can be tough for me—I just need to focus and keep pushing forward.

### Game Development

Working on it every day. It’s a multi-year project with a big scope, but I’m having a blast.

Just finished v1 of our internal wiki for story, worldbuilding, characters, etc.

### Learning Pixel Art

Still in the “fuzzy learning hours”—those first 100-300 hours of just messing around, figuring out what matters, and learning how to do what I want.

It’s messy, but I love it. Plus, I’m getting used to a graphic tablet and pen for the first time, which adds another layer of learning.

### Upcoming Gig

Playing a small set with Marta next Friday at Okendo K.E. in Donosti—currently practicing for that.

### Busking Soon

As the weather improves, I’ll be back to busking. That means refreshing my old cover repertoire—haven’t started yet, but very soon.

## Running

### 5K Milestone

Last Sunday, I hit my goal—[ran 19:41 for 5K,](https://www.strava.com/activities/13591095112) finally breaking 20 minutes! A huge lifelong running goal achieved.

### Next Goal

Now I want more, of course! Been logging lots of zone 2, talking pace kilometres this week, as recovery. Next race is a 10K in April, so I need to increase my training volume.

## Family Time

This week has been packed with family birthday celebrations, making it tough to get work done.

I planned ahead knowing it’d be a slow workweek, and I’ve really enjoyed it.

One more event tomorrow morning—bringing the total to four in one week, which is a lot for me (considering I see friends _maybe_ once a month).
