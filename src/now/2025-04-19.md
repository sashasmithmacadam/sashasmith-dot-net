### New Release – *[Childhood Naps]({{ '/naps/' | url }})*

Just released *[Childhood Naps]({{ '/naps/' | url }})*, the third and final single from my upcoming EP Running Down Dark Alleys Blind. That means the full EP is next.

### EP Progress

I’m deep in the last phase of finishing the EP:

- *[I Don't Belong in Your Arms]({{ '/idbiya/' | url }})* is done—mixed and mastered a few days ago.
- Currently recording *[In the End It Comes]({{ '/iteic/' | url }})*—the closing track.
- Only *[Numb]({{ '/numb/' | url }})* left to record, which will be the EP’s opening song.

### New Songs

I was hit by a writing spree recently—14 new songs in a burst. 

They’re folkier, simpler, and more direct. 

Just acoustic guitar, vocals, maybe a harmonica. 

Once the EP is done, I’ll start sharing acoustic videos for these. If people connect with them, I might record a lo-fi acoustic album in the spirit of *The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, Pink Moon, or Jackson C. Frank*.

### Busking Season Prep

With spring and summer coming in, I’m getting ready to busk again—to help fund my upcoming Spanish album. Just waiting for this rain to chill out. In the meantime, all focus is on the EP.

### Practice & Playing

I’ve been playing a lot. Learning harder songs to stretch myself: *Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright, Here Comes the Sun, Blues Run the Game, Girl from the North Country*. 

Writing more in that same folky style—it feels like the most honest version of what I love as a listener too. 

After 15 years playing, you hit plateaus—but I’m breaking through one now. I call it being *busking fit.* 

This kind of growth only happens when you go all in. And when you go all in, other things get set aside—fewer [newsletters]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}), fewer [essays]({{ '/essays/' | url }})… but more music, and better music. 

I’m good with that tradeoff. I’m a musician, not a newsletter writer (for now).

## Videogame Project

The game I’m working on with Ian and Ioseba is coming along well. 

I recently wrote the first original song for it—a refreshing creative shift. Still a long road ahead, but I’m really excited to share more when the time’s right.

## Life

### Cycling

Got back on the road bike for a couple rides before the rain hit—it’s been pouring for ten days straight. Exercise is on pause for now.

### Reading

Haven’t been reading much lately—too deep in writing, playing, recording. That’s fine. It all comes in *[cycles]({{ '/rhythm/' | url }})*.

## Things I’ve Enjoyed Lately

### Comic Book – *Vile and Miserable* by Samuel Cantin

About a demon who works at a used car lot/secondhand bookshop. So good, so funny. Highly recommend.

### Carrot Top

Been watching a lot of his stuff lately. Society (and especially other comedians) love to give him shit, but honestly, I love him. 

I’ve always been drawn to underdogs—and that only gets stronger the older I get. Screw trends, screw being “cool,” screw the herd, and especially screw people in your own field who hate on others. 

Carrot Top is funny, creative, and seems like a down-to-earth, kind, regular guy. That kind of longevity, without bitterness? Massive respect.

### Simple Moments

When I’m not playing or writing, I’ve been chilling with Marta and the cats. That’s, truly, the good stuff.
