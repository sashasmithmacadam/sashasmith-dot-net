Hey, it’s [Sash]({{ '/about/' | url }}).

I’m a [singer-songwriter]({{ '/music/' | url }}) who also:

- [Writes]({{ '/writing/' | url }}) a lot
- [Paints]({{ '/paintings/' | url }}) a little

I believe in creating & connecting.

My best work happens at the intersection between intuition and thinking.

[Success]({{ '/success/' | url }}), to me, is to keep playing the game of creation [until the day I die]({{ '/success/#die' | url }}).

For years, I got trapped in the attention conglomerates of social media. Now I’m a digital minimalist, standing firmly [against the brandification of artists]({{ '/brandification/' | url }}).

Do come in, [have a look around]({{ '/projects/' | url }}), and if you like what you see, consider [subscribing to my email list]({{ '/newsletter/' | url }}). I send occasional updates about projects and releases.

Lastly:

- {% include "snippets/link-projects.njk" %}
- {% include "snippets/link-now.njk" %}
- {% include "snippets/link-deep-dive.njk" %}

Please [reach out]({{ '/contact/' | url }}) anytime. I reply to every email and stay in touch with people all over the world.

That’s all, thanks for dropping by!
